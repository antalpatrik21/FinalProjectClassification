# Classification Project

#### This is a final project of mine created for IBM Course. 

### Have you ever wondered about what aspects make you a good applicant in the eye of a bank? Their goal is obviously to get their money and a bit plus in time.  No question, from their view, their main goal is to predict whether a given costumer will be able to fit their requirements.

### In this project you will be hired by a fictional bank let's say Royal Bank of Nowhere and your job is to make a prediction based on applicants background like education, age, gender for whether they going to pay back their loan or not.
